Welcome to my personal website, matthew-macri.com, a comprehensive portfolio and professional hub showcasing my technical expertise, projects, and work experience. I've designed this site to offer a clean and engaging user experience, highlighting my skills and achievements across various sections. On the home page, you'll find an introduction to me, featured projects, and the latest blog posts. In the "About Me" section, you can read an in-depth look at my biography, including my professional journey, education, personal interests, technical skills, and multilingual capabilities in English, French, and Spanish.

In the "Projects" section, I've included a portfolio of my work, with descriptions, 
technologies used, and links to repositories or live demos. Some projects feature
 detailed case studies, outlining the problem, solution, and impact. 
The blog section contains articles and tutorials on various technology topics, 
organized for easy navigation. In the "Resume" section, 
you'll find detailed descriptions of my work experience, particularly
my role as a Field Service Technician at the Department of National Defence, 
as well as my Computer Science studies at Vanier College. 
You can also download my resume in PDF format. 
If you'd like to get in touch, the "Contact" section includes a form for professional inquiries 
and links to my social media profiles. 
My website is hosted on Netlify, ensuring fast load times and reliable performance, 
and it features a fully responsive design 
built with modern web technologies for a smooth and interactive user experience.
This website is still underdevelopment, meaning that I am constantly working on it 
on my free time. Thank you !
